<div class="subtopics"> National Emergency?</div>
    <div class="bodytext bodytext1">
    Since taking office again, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared illegal immigration a national emergency. There are two methods of being deported, one called a Notice of Appear which issues a charging document that begins a proceeding against you being in the U.S. During this process, one can fight to stay in the US but would all have to go through court. If you don't win, then you are issued to leave. The other way is called an Expedited Removal. An expedited removal is a deportation process that is very fast tracked. This policy has always been limited to people who have been found around 100 miles near the border and within 14 days of entering. Ever since Trump has been reelected, this policy has been expanded nationwide and can now occur ANYWHERE in the US.

<div class="subtopics"> Seeking Asylum? Too bad!</div>
<div class="bodytext bodytext2">
    An Executive Order that Trump placed is an order that doesn't allow the entry of any undocumented migrants and has instructed to turn away anyone seeking asylum. What is asylum you ask? Asylum hearings are legal proceedings where an asylum seeker presents their case to authorities, demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country, to determine if they are eligible for asylum and protection in the United States. Under Trumps order, this legal proceeding is now being stopped.

    <div class="subtopics sub1">Mental Health</div>
    <div class="bodytext bodytext3">Deportation can seriously affect families, especially when a parent is taken away while their child is still young. Kids are more likely to struggle with mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and high levels of stress when a parent is detained or deported. Since late 2016, doctors and social workers have seen more and more children dealing with stress and anxiety, often tied to what's known as "toxic stress," because they're scared a family member might be deported. </div>
    <div class="subtopics sub2">Toxic Stress</div>
    <div class="bodytext bodytext4">
        Children will face toxic stress when they are abruptly separated from their parents, which harms their brain development. This stress also increases their risk of developing long-term mental health issues, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as physical health problems like cancer, stroke, diabetes, and heart disease.

        <div class="subtopics"> Fear</div>
        <div class="bodytext bodytext5">With ICE patrolling the streets, many children are no longer attending school because their immigrant parents are too afraid to leave their homes. In Illinois, State Superintendent of Schools Tony Sanders reported a noticeable decline in attendance, particularly among Latino students, as parents fear sending their children to school. The ongoing deportations have led to widespread absence in schools, preventing children from learning. </p></div></div>
        <div class="subtopics"> Attendence</div>
        <div class="bodytext bodytext6">Amid promises of mass deportations, schools in Massachusetts and across the country have recently seen an increase in absences among migrant students. Both families and some Massachusetts superintendents say the federal government’s immigration policies — which now permit Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to enter schools for arrests — are driving immigrant children away from safe learning environments. As families face the fear of immigration enforcement near schools, some have chosen to pull their children from classes altogether</div>
        <div class="subtopics sub3"> How Real is This?</div>
        <div class="bodytext bodytext7">  My sister, who works at a school, has shared that the fear among parents is keeping children at home. At her school, they organize food drives to support families in need, but because of the threat of ICE raids, parents are no longer participating in these events. Not only are the children missing out on their education, but some may also go hungry, all due to the fear and anxiety caused by the policies implemented during the Trump administration.
